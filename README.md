# lowComplexityUserMatching_StreamBasedPA_RSMA

## Installation

This project relies on **IBM CPLEX** and **CVXPY**, which require a specific Python version. We strongly recommend using **Anaconda** to manage the environment.

### Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)
This will create an environment named `rsma_optimization` with Python 3.10 and all necessary dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate rsma_optimization
